# Ages of Mankind
A grand-strategy game written in java focused on reasonably simulating
alternate history (for now in VERY early development stages)
---
# What am I trying to achieve?
I am trying to create a simulator without weird bot behavior, embracing historical logic.
In my game, there shall not be excessive border gore, unreasonable wars and alliances, etc. 
I am willing to accomplish that without systems already well-rooted in other games, like focus trees as they albeit great for 
creating short campaigns, become unscalable too quickly. At the end of main development, I strive for simulating
a few thousands of years of alternate scenarios with at least an acceptable course of actions.
